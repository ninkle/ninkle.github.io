					“What kind of urbanism will the program propose? An urbanism that is pro-planning, pro-artificial, anti-collapse, pro-universalist, 
					anti-anti-totality, pro-materialist, anti-anti-leviathan, anti-mythology, and pro-egalitarian distribution. It starts with a different set of assumptions: 
					the planet is artificially sentient; climate collapse mitigation and pervasive automation can converge; the concept of “climate change” is an 
					epistemological accomplishment of planetary-scale computation; automation is a general principle by which ecosystems work; necessary fundamental shifts in 
					geotechnology are likely to precede necessary fundamental shifts in geo-politics; “surveillance” of carbon flows is a good thing; energy infrastructures 
					based on long-term waste cycles are desirable; the ecological cost of “culture” is greater than that of science; planetarity requires philosophy in and of 
					outer space; speculative design must focus on what is so deeply functional as to be unlikely; and that, finally, 
					the future becomes something to be prevented as much as achieved.”

					“In other words, science and technology enable a particular set of conscious interventions within the so-called 
					‘natural’ world. Such interventions have the potential to extend human freedom – for example, by furthering reproductive 
					autonomy and allowing us to exert control (however contingent, contested, and constrained) over what happens to our own bodies. 
					Nature is understood here not as an essentializing underpinning for embodiment or ecology, but as a technologized space of 
					conflict that fundamentally shapes lived experiences.”

					“I have cultivated several personalities within myself. I constantly cultivate personalities. Each of my dreams, immediately after I dream it,

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> 
					"Accelerationism is a political heresy: the insistence that the only radical political response to capitalism is not to protest, disrupt, or critique, nor to await its 
					demise at the hands of its own contradictions,but to accelerate its uprooting, alienating, decoding, abstractive tendencies...At the basis of all accelerationist thought lies the assertion 
					that the crimes, contradictions and absurdities of capitalism have to be countered with a politically and theoretically progressive attitude towards its constituent elements. 
					Accelerationism seeks to side with the emancipatory dynamic that broke the chains of feudalism and ushered in the constantly ramifying range of practical possibilities 
					characteristic of modernity. The focus of much accelerationist thinking is the examination of the supposedly intrinsic link between these transformative forces and the 
					axiomatics of exchange value and capital accumulation that format contemporary planetary society."

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> 
					"Inasmuch as each genre of geopolitics deploys some figure of the planet, comparative planetology
					falls within the scope of the larger philosophical discipline of cosmology — the study of the metaphysical organisation 
					of the universe. Each figure of the planet represents a <i>cosmogram </i>— a model of a metaphysical organisation, a little 
					planetarium of relations. As architectural, visual, or discursive
					techniques, cosmograms present the totality of the metaphysical realm in a concrete form, establishing “the relation between different domains
					or ontological levels"."

					"What is called soul is the capacity of coming back to itself in order to know itself and determine itself — every time it departs from itself, 
					it actualized its own reflection in traces, which we call memory. It is in this extra in the form of difference that witnesses the movement of time, 
					while at the same time modifying the being that is itself time, so that it consequently constitutes the dynamic of the whole. Every difference is a differing, 
					deferring in time and being differed in space, a new creation. Every reflective movement leaves a trace like a road mark, every trace presents a questioning, 
					to which the answer can be addressed only by the movement in its totality"

					“What is a mirror? It’s the only invented material that is natural. Whoever looks at a mirror, whoever manages to see it without seeing himself, 
					whoever understands that its depth consists of being empty, whoever walks inside its transparent space without leaving the trace of his own image upon 
					it—that somebody has understood its mystery of thing. For that to happen one must surprise it when it’s alone, when it’s hanging in an empty room, without 
					forgetting that the finest needle before it can transform it into the simple image of a needle, so sensitive is the mirror in its quality of lightest reflection, 
					only image and not the body. Body of the thing.”

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> 
					"It seems obvious that we are confined in space to the surface of the earth, and in time to the length of a life. Fedorov’s imaginative achievement revolves around refusing to 
					mistake the ubiquity of these constraints—for all the great hold they exert—as inescapable necessities we have no choice but to accept. Those who point to the huge expanse of 
					the earth and the whole terrestrial history of life—this is nothing but myopia, squalid provincialism. In isolated form, this is the characteristic gesture of cosmism, what 
					we might call the “cosmist impulse”: to consider the earth a trap, and to understand the common project of philosophy, economics, and design as being the formulation of means to 
					escape from it: to conceive a jailbreak at the maximum possible scale, a heist in which we steal ourselves from the vault.""

					“In time the world will cool and everything will die; but that is a long time off still, and its present value at compound discount is almost nothing. Nor is the present
					less valiable because the future will be blank. Humanity, which fills the foreground of my picture, I find interesting and on the whole admirable. I find, just now at least, the world
					a pleasant and exciting place. You may find it depressing; I am sorry for you, and you despise me...On the other hand, I pity you with reason, because it is pleasanter to be 
					thrilled than to be depressed, and not merely pleasanter but better for all one's activities.”

					“It was the hour in which objects lose the consistency of shadow that accompanies them during the night and gradually reacquire

					“Designers are very good at making things, but medium design is less like making
					a thing and more like having your hands on the faders and toggles of
					organization. It is the design of interdependencies, chemistries, chain reactions
					and ratchets. It benefits from an artistic curiosity about spatial wiring or reagents
					in spatial mixtures, a curiosity about designing not a single object but a platform
					for inflecting populations of objects or setting up relative potentials within them."

					“Economic theories are now being subsumed and operationalized for the sake of computation, not the other way around. Classical economics and its cute little rational agents, 
					who were once the only ones that "counted", are becoming a marginal fiction, used for certain purposes in a much larger machine that looks towards higher goals. Economic,
					political, legal and social contexts are turned into computational and mathematical problems, solved in that realm, and then reapplied in an attempt at reconfiguring the economic,
					political, social and legal realms. This has caused both confusion and creativity; confusion by conflating computational models with political desires and social effects, and creativity by
					forcing a reassessment of the boundaries between disciplines, ideologies and entities. It has raised the question of which forces and sensibilities – mathematical, algorithmic, human, institutional,
					cultural or religios – we want to have determining whihc aspects of our lives."
