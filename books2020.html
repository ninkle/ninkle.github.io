				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> “I imagined a labyrinth of labyrinths, a maze of mazes, a twisting, turning, ever-widening labyrinth that contained both past and future and somehow implied the stars. Absorbed in those illusory imaginings, I forgot that I was a pursued man; I felt myself, for an indefinite while, the abstract perceiver of the world. The vague, living countryside, the moon, the remains of the day did their work in me; so did the gently downward road, which forestalled all possibility of weariness. The evening was near, yet infinite.”</p>

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> “This is what I mean when I say I would like to swim against the stream of time: I would like to erase the consequences of certain events and restore an initial condition. But every moment of my life brings with it an accumulation of new facts, and each of these new facts bring with it consequences; so the more I seek to return to the zero moment from which I set out, the further I move away from it. . . .”</p>

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;">“. . . yet there is no avoiding time, the sea of time, the sea of memory and forgetfulness, the years of promise, gone and unrecoverable, of the land almost allowed to claim its better destiny, only to have the claim jumped by evildoers known all too well, and taken instead and held hostage to the future we must live in now forever.”

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;">“If I had to choose an auspicious sign for the approach of the new millennium, I would choose this: the sudden nimble leap of the poet/philosopher who lifts himself against the weight of the world, proving that its heaviness contains the secret of lightness, while what many believe to be the life force of the times—loud and aggressive, roaring and rumbling—belongs to the realm of death, like a graveyard of rusted automobiles.”</p>

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> 	“We drove 22 miles into the country around Farmington. There were meadows and apple orchards. White fences trailed through the rolling fields. Soon the sign started appearing. THE MOST PHOTOGRAPHED BARN IN AMERICA. We counted five signs before we reached the site. There were 40 cars and a tour bus in the makeshift lot. We walked along a cowpath to the slightly elevated spot set aside for viewing and photographing. All the people had cameras; some had tripods, telephoto lenses, filter kits. A man in a booth sold postcards and slides -- pictures of the barn taken from the elevated spot. We stood near a grove of trees and watched the photographers. Murray maintained a aprolonged silence, occasionally scrawling some notes in a little book. <p>

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;">"No one sees the barn," he said finally. A long silence followed. </p>

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;">"Once you've seen the signs about the barn, it becomes impossible to see the barn." </p>

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> “My conclusion is that to play a game is to engage in activity directed
				towards bringing about a specific state of affairs. using only means permitted by rules. where the rules prohibit more efficient in favour ofless efficient means. and where such rules are accepted just because they make possible such activity.” </p>
