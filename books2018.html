		  <h1 style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;">A Year In Books</h1>
		  <p style="text-indent: 0px"><i>I read a lot of good stuff this year and wanted to put together a short piece about it.</i></p>
	</div>
  </div>
  <div class="w3-container">
  	<p> The contents in this little bit of writing encompass the things I read between May 2018 and May 2019. And because the things I think about are typically a product of the things that I read, this piece might also be considered a sketch, perhaps, of those thoughts.</p>

  	<p> Below, you'll notice that I've compiled the books I've read this year into a list (the order's arbitrary). From each book, I've selected a brief passage that I, for whatever reason, feel captures something interesting or important. Hopefully, at least one of these passages will pique your interest.</p>

  	<p>This year, change was abundant and the typical constants were in flux. I think that because of this, I spent a lot of time thinking about lives. In hindsight this was, perhaps, a way of grounding the fluctuations, of trying to lend some sort of coherent narrative structure to this rather nebulous collection of experience and circumstance. For me at least, narrative - in my own life, in the things I do, in the ways I engage and interact with the world - is this incredibly important thing; it's what transforms disparate miscellany into an object in its own right. And to objects, we can begin to ascribe all sorts of nice and comforting properties: form, temporality, motion, direction, animation, and the most comforting of all, purpose (in the sense of intentionality). And perhaps you, the reader, might turn up your nose at the notion of purpose as this sort of eye-roll-inducing fiction which serves only the function I've employed as its descriptor - <i>to comfort</i> - but I'd argue to you that the fictional nature of a thing bears, at least wrt to anything related to human experience, little to nil on its importance.</p>

  	<p>A (nonfictious) life conceived in the written form is most naturally captured as biography (9, 11, 12, 13), in which narrative is dictated by the facts at hand. We have miscellany, yes, but the biographer's job is to curate and arrange those facts such that the underlying narrative (which has (hopefully) been nicely cultivated by the biographee - it's a probable guess that this is the case; the sort of people about whom others feel compelled to write tend to also be the sort of people whose personal miscellany revolves around some unifying factor) surfaces and sharpens and is displayed for us, the readers, to examine.</p>

  	<p>We might instantiate the fictional (though again, no less important) life in a variety of forms; I'm particularly partial to the Bildungsroman (2, 5, 7, 8) as a medium for literary accounts. Here, the causal order is inverted; narrative predates facts. As such, the writer has the liberty to cherry-pick each major plot point, each minute detail of the protagonist's life from a near-infinite sample space to further the central thread he's opted to develop. This is a fairly trivial and non-interesting observation. However, the hope - and the reason I bothered to mention it at all - is to push the thesis that this bidirectional understanding of the fact-narrative relationship offers the most comprehensive and, therefore, effective way of injecting narrative structure to one's own life. <u>Paraphrase</u>: if this is something you care about at all, the factual and the fictional carry equal weight. </p>

  	<p> As a final word on the topic, I think that each of us <i>should</i> care. We are each, implicitly, both author and biographer. <u>This is not a thesis but a fact</u>; unless you're willing to forego any/all claims to (in the case of the former) personal autonomy or (in the case of the latter) an enduring sense of self, then we can conclude that we are, indeed, authoring and chronicling in real time. And what's more, one is not just the author but too the <i>authored</i>; not just the biographer but too the <i>biographee</i> - one is both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(philosophy)">subject</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)">object</a>. The very act of living a human life - one capable of all the nice things that make a human life <i>human</i>; introspection, retrospection, autonomy, self-awareness, to name but a few - wholly subverts the traditional mode of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/object/#ContObjeVsSubj">subject-object relations</a> and my claim here is that the narratives we build for and about ourselves are the ultimate product of this subversion. Again, I'll offer a paraphrase: our personal narratives serve as good proxies for the lives we lead and as such depth, breadth, intricacy, etc. of those narratives are a neat approximation of the corresponding metric as a measure of life.</p>

    <p>The narratives we construct are only good and useful and important only insofar as they latch onto something true. That's not to suggest that they must be truisms per se. In fact, one of the most interesting parts of authorship is in the synthesis, the act birthing some new thing - the caveat here is that the parents of the thing must themselves be truisms. </p>

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> “My life, I resolved, ought to be a perpetual transcending, a progression from stage to stage; I wanted it to pass through one area after the next, leaving each behind, as music moves on from theme to theme, from tempo to tempo, playing each out to the end, completing each and leaving it behind, never tiring, never sleeping, forever wakeful, forever in the present. In connection with the experiences of awakening, I had noticed that such stages and such areas exist, and that each successive period in one’s life bears within itself, as it is approaching its end, a note of fading and eagerness for death. That in turn leads to a shifting to a new area, to awakening and new beginnings.” </p>

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> 	“In his letter, Langlands proposed the possibility of a deep analogy between two theories that seemed to lie at opposite ends of the mathematical cosmos: the theory of Galois groups, which concerns symmetries in the realm of numbers, and “harmonic analysis”, which concerns how complicated waves are build up from simple harmonies. Certain structures in the harmonic world “knew” about mysterious patterns in the world of numbers This is might be possible to use the methods of one world to reveal hidden harmonies in the other – so Langlands conjectured. If Weil did not find the intuitions in the letter persuasive, Langlands added, “I am sure you have a waste basket handy”.”  </p>
