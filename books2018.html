		  <h1 style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;">A Year In Books</h1>
		  <p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> [WIP] I read a lot of good stuff this year and wanted to put together a short piece about it. </p>
	</div>
  </div>
  <div class="w3-container">
  	<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace; text-indent: 40px"> The contents in this little bit of writing encompass the things I read between May 2018 and May 2019. And because the things I think about are typically a product of the things that I read, this piece might also be considered a sketch, perhaps, of those thoughts. 
  	</p>
  	<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace; text-indent: 40px"> Below, you'll notice that I've compiled the books I've read this year into a list (the order's arbitrary). From each book, I've selected a brief passage that I, for whatever reason, feel captures something interesting or important. Hopefully, at least one of these passages will pique your interest.
  	</p>
  	<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace; text-indent: 40px"> This year, change was abundant and the typical constants were in flux. I think because of this, I spent a lot of time thinking about lives - I graviated towards biographical accounts (9, 11, 12, 13) and Bildungsromans (2, 5, 7, 8). Of the latter, the Hesse novels (2, 7) were particularly special to me. There were many thematic elements which felt especially poignant - <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Siddhartha (2)</span> is a story of perpetual rebirth (a nod to Hesse's love for Buddhist philosophy) - that is, the story of a single life which itself contains many. It's a story about both the fluidity of the singular self and the many selves the singular contains - some wise, some foolish, some good, and some evil - and how the potential for each of these selves is within each of us at all times, the story of their emergence and disappearance - the way in which they flow into, bear on, and shape each other - telling the story of a life.
  	</p>
  	<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace; text-indent: 40px">Earlier this year, I attended a retrospective of <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><a href="https://www.artsy.net/show/montreal-museum-of-fine-arts-alexander-calder-radical-inventor">Alexander Calder's work (14)</a></span> presented by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. Non-contentious claim - Calder was a genius and MMFA did a brilliant job showcasing what felt like an endless number of pieces. Cut to the entrance and we're greeted by a set of sculpted wire portraits, set in front of a crisp white wall, dangling from strands of fishing line and illuminated from an angle. The lighting is set up in such a way that the wiring of the portraits eachs casts its own shadow upon the wall, collapsing three dimensions to two - lines separable in three-dimensional space are now forced to overlap and intersect each other in complex and interesting ways. In moving through spatial dimensions, we see something new emerge. And now, this begs the question: do we distinguish between these two forms? That is, are we to consider these objects distinct in their own right or are they one and the same? To my great surprise, the transformation of Calder's sculptures through spatial dimensions quite nicely mirrors the transformation of Hesse's Siddhartha through the temporal one. 
  	</p>
  	<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace; text-indent: 40px">On that note, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">The Glass Bead Game (7)</span>, was possibly my favourite read of the year. Set in a distant future, Hesse's protagonist Joseph Knecht quickly rises through the ranks of society's intellectual elite, a prodigy of Hesse's byzantine invention - the Glass Bead Game. The (alluring) premise of the GBG is the distillation of our intellectual history - music, mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and so on - to a set of abstract symbols, a universal language via which themes and structures of these disparate branches can speak to each other. Players seek to weave these themes and structures into a intricate tapestry, synthesizing decades of scholarship into some unifying narrative, which both illuminates the hidden truths of its source materials and is too some profound truth in itself.
  	</p>

  	<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace; text-indent: 40px">I found (and still find) the premise of the GBG beautiful. Thinking now, it feels remniscient of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langlands_program">Langlands program</a>, possibly my favourite project in the history of mathematical research and on which my favourite essay from <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">When Einstein Walked With Godel (11)</span> is written.
  	</p>

  	<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace; text-indent: 40px">Despite the inclination of its title, however, the novel is less about the game as it is the player. The peak of Knecht's arc is characterized by rampant tension between That said, another realization which has just dawned on me is how incredibly indebted this idea of thematic distillation and language reformation feels to Wittgenstein - particularly to the <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Tractatus (4)</span>, which is one of the works listed below. And with that realization, it seems too that Knecht's story closely mirrors Wittgenstein's philosophical arc from the austerity and precision of the Tractatus to the animated and almost corporeal feel of his later work, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Philosophical Investigations</span> (not listed here).

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> “My life, I resolved, ought to be a perpetual transcending, a progression from stage to stage; I wanted it to pass through one area after the next, leaving each behind, as music moves on from theme to theme, from tempo to tempo, playing each out to the end, completing each and leaving it behind, never tiring, never sleeping, forever wakeful, forever in the present. In connection with the experiences of awakening, I had noticed that such stages and such areas exist, and that each successive period in one’s life bears within itself, as it is approaching its end, a note of fading and eagerness for death. That in turn leads to a shifting to a new area, to awakening and new beginnings.” </p>

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> 	“In his letter, Langlands proposed the possibility of a deep analogy between two theories that seemed to lie at opposite ends of the mathematical cosmos: the theory of Galois groups, which concerns symmetries in the realm of numbers, and “harmonic analysis”, which concerns how complicated waves are build up from simple harmonies. Certain structures in the harmonic world “knew” about mysterious patterns in the world of numbers This is might be possible to use the methods of one world to reveal hidden harmonies in the other – so Langlands conjectured. If Weil did not find the intuitions in the letter persuasive, Langlands added, “I am sure you have a waste basket handy”.”  </p>

To himself, he always appears to be doing both.” </p>

If you think about it, it’s precisely because people are different from others that they’re able to create their own independent selves...the fact that I’m me and no one else is one of my greatest assets. Emotional hurt is the price a person has to pay in order to be independent." </p>
