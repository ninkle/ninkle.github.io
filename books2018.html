		  <p style="text-indent: 0px"><i>I read a lot of good stuff this year and wanted to put together a short piece about it.</i></p>
	</div>
  </div>
  <div class="w3-container">
  	<p> The contents in this little bit of writing encompass the things I read between May 2018 and May 2019. And because the things I think about are typically a product of the things that I read, this piece might also be considered a sketch, perhaps, of those thoughts.</p>

  	<p> Below, you'll notice that I've compiled the books I've read this year into a list (the order's arbitrary). From each book, I've selected a brief passage that I, for whatever reason, feel captures something interesting or important. Hopefully, at least one of these passages will pique your interest.</p>

  	<p>This year, change was abundant and the typical constants were in flux. I think that because of this, I spent a lot of time thinking about lives. In hindsight this was, perhaps, a way of grounding the fluctuations, of trying to lend some sort of coherent narrative structure to this rather nebulous collection of experience and circumstance. For me at least, narrative - in my own life, in the things I do, in the ways I engage and interact with the world - is this incredibly important thing; it's what transforms disparate miscellany into an object in its own right. And to objects, we can begin to ascribe all sorts of nice and comforting properties: form, temporality, motion, direction, animation, and the most comforting of all, purpose (in the sense of intentionality). And perhaps you, the reader, might turn up your nose at the notion of purpose as this sort of eye-roll-inducing fiction which serves only the function I've employed as its descriptor - <i>to comfort</i> - but I'd argue to you that the fictional nature of a thing bears, at least wrt to anything related to human experience, little to nil on its importance.</p>

  	<p>A (nonfictious) life conceived in the written form is most naturally captured as biography (9, 11, 12, 13), in which narrative is dictated by the facts at hand. We have miscellany, yes, but the biographer's job is to curate and arrange those facts such that the underlying narrative (which has (hopefully) been nicely cultivated by the biographee - it's a probable guess that this is the case; the sort of people whom others feel compelled to write about tend to also be the sort of people whose personal miscellany revolves around some unifying factor) surfaces and sharpens and is displayed for us, the readers, to examine.</p>

  	<p>We might instantiate the fictional (though again, no less important) life in a variety of forms; I'm particularly partial to the Bildungsroman (2, 5, 7, 8) as a medium for literary accounts. Here, the causal order is inverted; narrative predates facts. As such, the writer has the liberty to cherry-pick each major plot point, each minute detail of the protagonist's life from a near-infinite sample space to further the central thread he's opted to develop. This is a fairly trivial and non-interesting observation. However, the hope - and the reason I bothered to mention it at all - is to push the thesis that this bidirectional understanding of the fact-narrative relationship offers the most comprehensive and, therefore, effective way of injecting narrative structure to one's own life. <u>Paraphrase</u>: if this is something you care about at all, the factual and the fictional carry equal weight. </p>

  	<p> As a final word on the topic, I think that each of us <i>should</i> care. We are each, implicitly, both author and biographer. <u>This is not a thesis but a fact</u>; unless you're willing to forego any/all claims to (in the case of the former) personal autonomy or (in the case of the latter) an enduring sense of self, then we can conclude that we are, indeed, authoring and chronicling in real time. And what's more, one is not just the author but too the <i>authored</i>; not just the biographer but too the <i>biographee</i> - one is both <i>subject</i> and <i>object</i>. The very act of living a human life - one capable of all the nice things that make a human life <i>human</i>; introspection, retrospection, autonomy, self-awareness, to name but a few - wholly subverts the traditional mode of subject-object relations and my claim here is that the narratives we build for and about ourselves are the ultimate product of this subversion. Again, I'll offer a paraphrase: our personal narratives serve as good proxies for the lives we lead and as such depth, breadth, intricacy, etc. of those narratives are a neat approximation of the corresponding metric as a measure of life.</p>

  	<p> Hesse's Siddhartha (2) is a wonderful illustration of fact coalescing to narrative. Actually, to be precise (and totally pedantic), as a fictional piece it's a wonderful illustration of narrative dictating fact to illustrate fact coalescing to narrative. That said, I'd suggest that you ignore the entirety of the previous, tortured sentence (as it's neither important nor pleasant to read) and lend your attention to the subsequent ones. Hesse's protagonist epitomizes miscellany - we follow Siddhartha along orthogonal turn after orthogonal turn - from the holy scholarship of the Brahmins to the austerity of the ascetics; from the indulgence of a merchant to the simple life of ferryman. Siddhartha struggles, it seems, with that miscellany. For whatever reason, we're enamoured with linearity. I imagine that this is because there's a certain efficiency to linear movement - it's cohesive, streamlined, sure. Miscellany is uncertain, eratic, erroneous. Siddhartha's (Hesse's) brilliant move, however, is to eventually overlay the miscellany with what I think is a beautiful, unifying truth: the Self (in the singular) comprised of many selves (in the plural) - some wise, some foolish, some good, some evil - the potential for each of these is contained within each of us, always*.
  	</p>

  	<p style="font-size:80%;">*There's a nice little anecdote associated with the asterisked sentence that is too interesting (in my opinion) to be sentenced to footnote land but also not tied closely enough to the central theme of this piece to be worked in directly so I'm going to shrink the font size and stick it here as a compromise. Earlier this year, I attended a retrospective of <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><a href="https://www.artsy.net/show/montreal-museum-of-fine-arts-alexander-calder-radical-inventor">Alexander Calder's work (14)</a></span> presented by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. Non-contentious claim - Calder was a genius and MMFA showcased that genius in spades. Cut to the entrance and we're greeted by a set of sculpted wire portraits, set in front of a crisp white wall, dangling from strands of fishing line and illuminated from an angle. The lighting is set up in such a way that the wiring of the portraits each casts its own shadow upon the wall, collapsing three dimensions to two - lines separable in three-dimensional space are now forced to overlap and intersect each other in complex and interesting ways. In moving through spatial dimensions, we see something new emerge. And now, do we distinguish between these two forms - are we to consider these objects distinct in their own right or are they one and the same? Further, is one primary to other? And if we were to project three dimensions to four, what features might materialize? <u> Contentious claim - in one we find many</u>. To my great surprise, the transformation of Calder's sculptures through spatial dimensions quite nicely mirrors the transformation of Hesse's Siddhartha through the temporal one.</p> 

  	<p> The narratives we construct are only good and useful and important only insofar as they latch onto something true. That's not to suggest that they must be truisms per se. In fact, one of the most interesting parts of authorship is in the synthesis, the act birthing some new thing - the caveat here is that the parents of the thing must themselves be truisms (facts). Hesse is true to this rule - factually, Siddhartha was a Brahmin, an ascetic, a merchant, and a ferryman; we remark (again, as a matter of fact) that he was ambitious, abstinent, lustful, and tranquil respectively. The novel stroke of insight, the understanding that shifts fact to narrative, is in the realization that this is not a case of <i>was</i>; this is a case of <i>is</i>. Siddhartha <i>is</i> and always was the Brahmin; <i>is</i> and always was the ascetic; <i>is</i> and always was the merchant; <i>is</i> and always was the ferryman. There's a phenomenal bit I've appended to my list below but is perhaps also worth sharing here,</p>

  	<p>“<i>He no longer saw the face of his friend Siddhartha, instead he saw other faces, many, a long sequence, a flowing river of faces, of hundreds, of thousands, which all came and disappeared, and yet all seemed to be there simultaneously, which constantly changed and renewed themselves, and which were still all Siddhartha...he saw all of these figures and faces in a thousand relationships with one another, each one helping the other, loving it, hating it, destroying it, giving re-birth to it, each one was a will to die, a passionately painful confession of transitoriness, and yet none of them died, each one only transformed, was always re-born, received evermore a new face, without any time having passed between the one and the other face — and all of these figures and faces rested, flowed, generated themselves, floated along and merged with each other, and they were all constantly covered by something thin, without individuality of its own, but existing, like a thin glass or ice, like a transparent skin, a shell or mold or mask of water, and this mask was smiling, and this mask was Siddhartha’s smiling face...</i>” -Siddhartha</p>

<!-- 
  	<p> Hesse's <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Siddhartha (2)</span> is a wonderful illustration of fact colescing to narrative (granted, this is a fictional piece so earlier comments about the latter predating the former apply but the way it's written is intended, I think, to be a meditation on the converse). It'	s a story of perpetual rebirth - that is, the story of a single life which itself contains many. Hesse nods to the fluidity of the singular self and the many selves the singular contains - some wise, some foolish, some good, some evil - and how the potential for each of these selves is contained within each of us at all times. Their emergence and disappearance - the way in which they flow into, bear on, and shape each other - tells the story of a life.</p>

  	<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace; text-indent: 40px">On that note, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">The Glass Bead Game (7)</span>, was possibly my favourite read of the year. Set in a distant future, Hesse's protagonist Joseph Knecht quickly rises through the ranks of society's intellectual elite, a prodigy of Hesse's byzantine invention - the Glass Bead Game. The (alluring) premise of the GBG is a distillation of our intellectual history - music, mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, physics, and so on - to a set of abstract symbols, a universal language via which themes and structures of these disparate branches can speak to each other. Players seek to weave these themes and structures into a intricate tapestry, synthesizing decades of scholarship into some unifying narrative, which both illuminates the hidden truths of its source materials and is too some profound truth in itself. "The Glass Bead Game", Hesse writes, "is thus a mode of playing with the total contents and values of our culture; it plays with them as, say, in the great age of the arts a painter might have played with the colours on his palette.” There is a Wittgensteinian feel to this game (at least wrt to his early work in the <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Tractatus (4)</span> - the thematic distillation to symbolic representation, a sort of logical atomism defining some immaculate semantic space in which the obfuscation of normal, day-to-day language falls away to reveal each thing, each phenomenon, in its essence. 
  	</p>


  	<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace; text-indent: 40px">Despite its title, however, the novel is less about the game as it is the player. As Knecht arc develops, his character is increas It seems too that Knecht's story closely mirrors Wittgenstein's philosophical arc from the austerity and precision of the Tractatus to the animated and almost corporeal feel of his later work, <span style=background-color: #FFFF00">Philosophical Investigations</span> (not listed here).</p> -->

In connection with the experiences of awakening, I had noticed that such stages and such areas exist, and that each successive period in one’s life bears within itself, as it is approaching its end, a note of fading and eagerness for death.
