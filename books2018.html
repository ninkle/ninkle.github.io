  	<p> The contents in this little bit of writing encompass the things I read between May 2018 and May 2019. And because the things I think about are typically a product of the things that I read, this piece might also be considered a sketch, perhaps, of those thoughts.</p>

  	<p> Below, you'll notice that I've compiled the books I've read this year into a list (the order's arbitrary). From each book, I've selected a brief passage that I, for whatever reason, feel captures something interesting or important. In hindsight, I think that each of them also greatly informs the content of what's written below.  Hopefully, at least one of these passages will pique your interest.</p>

  	<p>This year, change was abundant and the typical constants were in flux. I think that because of this, I spent a lot of time thinking about lives. In hindsight this was, perhaps, a way of grounding the fluctuations, of trying to lend some sort of coherent narrative structure to this rather nebulous collection of experience and circumstance. For me at least, narrative - in my own life, in the things I do, in the ways I engage and interact with the world - is this incredibly important thing; it's what transforms disparate miscellany into an object in its own right. And to objects, we can begin to ascribe all sorts of nice and comforting properties: form, temporality, motion, direction, animation, and the most comforting of all, purpose (in the sense of intentionality). And perhaps you, the reader, might turn up your nose at the notion of purpose as this sort of eye-roll-inducing fiction which serves only the function I've employed as its descriptor - <i>to comfort</i> - but I'd argue to you that <b>the fictional nature of a thing bears, at least wrt to anything related to human experience, little to nil on its importance.</b></p>

  	<p>A (nonfictious) life conceived in the written form is most naturally captured as biography (9, 11, 12, 13), in which narrative is dictated by the facts at hand. We have miscellany, yes, but the biographer's job is to curate and arrange those facts such that the underlying narrative (which has (hopefully) been nicely cultivated by the biographee - it's a probable guess that this is the case; the sort of people about whom others feel compelled to write tend to also be the sort of people whose personal miscellany revolves around some unifying factor) surfaces and sharpens and is displayed for us, the readers, to examine.</p>

  	<p>We might instantiate the fictional (though again, no less important) life in a variety of forms; I'm particularly partial to the Bildungsroman (2, 5, 7, 8) as a medium for literary accounts. Here, the causal order is inverted; narrative predates facts. As such, the writer has the liberty to cherry-pick each major plot point, each minute detail of the protagonist's life from a near-infinite sample space to further the central thread he's opted to develop. This is a fairly trivial and non-interesting observation. However, the hope - and the reason I bothered to mention it at all - is to push the thesis that this bidirectional understanding of the fact-narrative relationship offers the most comprehensive and, therefore, effective way of injecting narrative structure to one's own life. <u>Paraphrase</u>: if this is something you care about at all, the factual and the fictional carry equal weight. </p>

  	<p> As a final word on the topic, I think that each of us <i>should</i> care. We are each, implicitly, both author and biographer. <b>This is not a thesis but a fact</b>; unless you're willing to forego any/all claims to (in the case of the former) personal autonomy or (in the case of the latter) an enduring sense of self, then we can conclude that we are, indeed, authoring and chronicling in real time. And what's more, one is not just the author but too the <i>authored</i>; not just the biographer but too the <i>biographee</i> - one is both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(philosophy)">subject</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)">object</a>. The very act of living a human life - one capable of all the nice things that make a human life <i>human</i>; introspection, retrospection, autonomy, self-awareness, to name but a few - wholly subverts the traditional mode of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/object/#ContObjeVsSubj">subject-object relations</a> and my claim here is that the narratives we build for and about ourselves are the ultimate product of this subversion. Again, I'll offer a paraphrase: our personal narratives serve as good proxies for the lives we lead and as such, <b>the depth, breadth, intricacy, etc. of those narratives are a neat approximation of the corresponding metric as a measure of life</b>. If one can make sense of past facts and dictate future ones in such a way that they together form a rich and compelling <i>story</i>, then I argue that one is exercising a remarkable and unique human ability and as much as we might be inclined to be all sorts of nitpicky and pedantic about what it means to live <i>meaningfully</i>, I'd also wager to argue that this is about as close as it gets.</p>

    <p>The narratives we construct are only good and useful and important only insofar as they latch onto something true. That's not to suggest that they must be truisms per se. In fact, one of the most interesting parts of authorship is in the synthesis, the act birthing some new thing - the caveat here is that the parents of the thing must themselves be truisms. False narrative is a dangerous delusion. This means that we, as honest biographers, bear an onus to include not just the lovely, flattering facts of our lives but too the unlovely - the vices, transgressions, banalities. Honesty is comprehensive. <b>It seems to me that we tend to be terrible biographers, as far as honesty goes; we have a tendency to filter, to select only the most favourable facts of the lot, quietly sweeping the less so under the rug or tucking them into musty cabinets where they can remain hidden both from our own memories and the world at large</b>. With the favourable we construct tidy, pleasing stories about ourselves, but these are partial pictures. These are easy. It is far more difficult to induce cohesion over a set of contrary facts; more often than not, however, this is precisely what we are working with. This is where the work begins - take the facts of past, arrange them, display them in full - do this with equal care for both the good and the bad - and from them, distill narrative in full. The difficulty is two-fold. First, the misshapen mass of contrary facts does not lend itself nicely to cohesion - the bits of dissonance jut out at awkward angles and distort edges and make the overall task of finding some nice, smooth shape to the thing seem near impossible. The second is that in order to actually do this - to find the nice, smooth shape - we need to peek under the rugs and into the cabinets and shine a light on those unlovely, unfavourable facts. And this is usually a fairly awful experience because in shining that light we mentally relive all those times in which we were naive or selfish or unkind or cowardly or whichever unflattering adjective applies. But if we can do this then our work is honest and that honesty will beget understanding and understanding - of the facts, of the past, of ourselves - is important in unenumerable ways.</p>

    <p>As authors, however, our facts are yet unwritten; in lieu of rugs and cabinets under and in which to peer, we have canvases upon which to paint. With those canvases comes an opportunity to choose the facts, and if we are mindful of our choices here then this too is an opportunity to do better, to <i>be</i> better. But authorship is not without its own tribulations. First, the very idea of "better" begs the question of what exactly we mean when we say "better" - this is one of those elusive concepts that seems to gravitate towards some fundamental truth but whose exact contours admit a certain degree of creative freedom. This is the first onus on the author. Second, given that we've come up with some plausible definition for the word "better", we have to decide how to instantiate it - quite often this may be done in a variety of ways, so again we find ourselves admitted our creative freedom. Again, the paradox of choice. This is the second onus. The final hurdle is in the execution, the paint to the canvas; it is one thing to conceive of the fact - it is another altogether to realize it. <b>I think that the very best facts, the ones that most wholly instantiate whichever concept of "better" we've decided upon, are often the most difficult to realize</b>. They require effort, integrity, resolve (one might argue that this is what at least partially, if not largely, merits their position in the upper echelons of "better").</p>

    <p>I'll take a moment now to pause and say that neither of these things need be nearly so difficult as what's been described. That's one of the wonderful (or alternatively, paralyzing) things about living - we get to choose, always. We can chronicle and author to whichever degree of precision and intricacy we so choose. Quite often, opting to take less care, to be less mindful, saves you a great deal of headache. But as with all art forms - and my (second from) last argument to make here is that these two feats are, indeed, artistic pursuits - le bon Dieu est dans le détail. <b>Good art demands</b> - both from the artist and the observer - <b>but it also rewards</b>. And again, as we occupy the roles of both the artist and the observer but too the art piece itself, I hope (for whichever reasons we deign) to reward and to be rewarded. Final argument: as we take more care, as we cede to greater and greater demands - as we become better authors and better biographers - it gets easier. The author who writes a future for a carefully chronicled past builds on a richer and more ready context - the canvas is primed, the palette diverse. The biographer who curates the mindfully authored facts finds them neatly queued on the window sill, anticipating display.</p>

    <p>The crux of this essay is simply to say this: if we wish to become better biographers, which we should, it is important that we read the work of better biographers. If we wish to become better authors, which we should, it is important that we read the work of better authors. And because these two roles are so deeply intertwined, if we wish to develop a truly, fully - for lack of a better word, <i>human</i> - mode of living, to meaningfully transform miscellany to narrative, then it is also important that we do them both.

    <p>So as a final word to everyone who's come across this piece, happy reading - and moreover, happy writing.
