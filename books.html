				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> "The head is separate; the hand is separate. Body and mind are separate.</p>

				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> The hand is a mirror for the mind – wrap your arm over your head, lodging your elbow behind and grabbing your chin with your hand. The act is now complete. Held, you are holding. You are object and subject, viewed and voyeur." </p>
