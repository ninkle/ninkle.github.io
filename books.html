				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> "The head is separate; the hand is separate. Body and mind are separate.</p>
				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> The hand is a mirror for the mind – wrap your arm over your head, lodging your elbow behind and grabbing your chin with your hand. The act is now complete. Held, you are holding. You are object and subject, viewed and voyeur." </p>

				<li style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/286568/siddhartha-by-hermann-hesse/9780142437186/readers-guide/"> Siddhartha </a></li>
				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> 	“He no longer saw the face of his friend Siddhartha, instead he saw other faces, many, a long sequence, a flowing river of faces, of hundreds, of thousands, which all came and disappeared, and yet all seemed to be there simultaneously, which constantly changed and renewed themselves, and which were still all Siddhartha...he saw all of these figures and faces in a thousand relationships with one another, each one helping the other, loving it, hating it, destroying it, giving re-birth to it, each one was a will to die, a passionately painful confession of transitoriness, and yet none of them died, each one only transformed, was always re-born, received evermore a new face, without any time having passed between the one and the other face— and all of these figures and faces rested, flowed, generated themselves, floated along and merged with each other, and they were all constantly covered by something thin, without individuality of its own, but existing, like a thin glass or ice, like a transparent skin, a shell or mold or mask of water, and this mask was smiling, and this mask was Siddhartha’s smiling face...” </p>

				<li style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/books/both-flesh-and-not-by-david-foster-wallace.html"> Both Flesh And Not </a></li>
				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> The need to indite, inscribe – be its fulfillment exhilarating or palliative or, as is more usual, neither – springs from the doubly-bound panic felt by most persons who spend a lot of time up in their own personal heads...the need to get the words & voices not only out – outside the sixteen-inch diameter of both that both births and imprisons them - but also down...a necessary affirmation of an outside, some Exterior one’s written record can not only communicate with but inhabit...”I EXIST” is the signal that throbs under most voluntary writing - & all good writing. </p>

				<li style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> <a href=https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312278496"> The Glass Bead Game</a> </li>
				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> “My life, I resolved, ought to be a perpetual transcending, a progression from stage to stage; I wanted it to pass through one area after the next, leaving each behind, as music moves on from theme to theme, from tempo to tempo, playing each out to the end, completing each and leaving it behind, never tiring, never sleeping, forever wakeful, forever in the present. In connection with the experiences of awakening, I had noticed that such stages and such areas exist, and that each successive period in one’s life bears within itself, as it is approaching its end, a note of fading and eagerness for death. That in turn leads to a shifting to a new area, to awakening and new beginnings.” </p>
