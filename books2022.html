				<p style="font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> 
					“A plurality of independent and unmerged voices and consciousnesses, a genuine polyphony of fully valid voices is in fact the chief
					characteristic of Dostoevsky's novels. What unfolds in his works is not a multitude of characters and fates in a single objective world,
					illuminated by a single authorial consciousness; rather a plurality of consciousnesses, with equal rights and each with its own world,
					combine but are not merged in the unity of the event. Dostoevksy's major heroes are, by the very nature of his creative design, not only
					objects of authorial discourse but also subjects of their own directly signifying discourse.”

					“He clung absurdly to the idea that at nine-thirty the food would be distributed and the sick would have to be visited, the situation would
					have to be examined with Taunus and the farmer in the Ariane; then it would be night, Dauphine sneaking into his car, stars or clouds, life. 
					Yes, it had to be like that. All that couldn't have ended forever. Maybe the soldier would get some water, which had been scarce the last few hours; at any rate, 
					you could always count on Porsche, as long as you paid his price. And on the car's atenna the red-cross flag waved madly, and you moved at fifty-five miles an hour 
					toward the lights that kept growing, not knowing why all this hurry, why this mad race in the night among unknown cars, where no one knew anything about the others,
					where everyone looked straight ahead, only ahead.”

					“And yet I have constructed in my mind a model city from which all possible cities can be deduced,” Kublai said. 
					“It contains everything corresponding to the norm. Since the cities that exist diverge in varying degree from the norm, 
					I need only foresee the exceptions to the norm and calculate the most probable combinations.” 
					
					“I have also thought of a model city from which I deduce all the others,” Marco answered. 
					“It is a city made only of exceptions, exclusions, incongruities, contradictions. 
					If such a city is the most improbable, by reducing the number of abnormal elements, 
					we increase the probability that the city really exists. So I have only to subtract exceptions 
					from my model, and in whatever direction I proceed, I will arrive at one of the cities which, 
					always as an exception, exist. But I cannot force my operation beyond a certain limit: 
					I would achieve cities too probable to be real."
